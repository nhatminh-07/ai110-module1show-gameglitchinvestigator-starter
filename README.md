# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- The game's purpose is to find the secret number between 1 and 100 in no more than 8 steps (Normal mode), 1 ... 50 in no more than 6 steps (Easy) and 1...20 in no more than 5 steps (Hard)
- I have found some bugs. The first bugs that I found is the fact that I the hints are very misleading. The problems of the Higher: you get were reversed, and the try...attempt to reverse strings was typically wrong. I tried my best to resolve this issue, knowing that it could run.
- AI have solved and refactored the code well. Consequently, it write unit tests that checked good coverage of the test cases of the helper programs, which help me being confident with the tests.
